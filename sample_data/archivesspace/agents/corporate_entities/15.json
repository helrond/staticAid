They are confident with their security and conitnuity plan, although they did not have details. They anticipate the migration from Gifts to the new system to take approximately a year. They would like representatives from the  RAC to visit and see the new system while it is in the customization stage so we could have input on possible method for extracting data.  They will let us know when they are ready to show it to us. They suggested a system whereby they just let us know when a grant has closed and is ready for archiving and then we go into the system and capture the appropriate files from the web. In my opinion, this seems to be potentially putting the onus of selection too much on the RAC staff.\n\nThe new grants system will allow for grant related emails to be appended. They do not wish to explore archiving of the rest of their email at this time due to concerns over sensitive personal information being mixed in with business related correspondence. They are also content for now with archiving their webiste through Archive.org and feel that the portions of the website that would be essential for archiving at the RAC are being sent to us in other formats, such as publications. They were interested in our list of recommended formats and normalization strategy, so I sent then that information via email. \n\nThere was also discussion over potential concerns regarding the need for different Conditions Governing Access restrictions distinguishing between material open for research in the RAC Reading Room versus material open for research and \"publication\" in the RAC Digital Archive. There was some indication that the concern over unvetted online access to Commonwealth Fund records could be alleviated by an online patron registration system. \n\n", "create_time": "2014-12-06T02:40:41Z", "address_1": "One East 75th Street ", "system_mtime": "2014-12-06T02:40:41Z", "last_modified_by": "admin", "email": "DD@CMWF.ORG", "telephones": [{"system_mtime": "2014-12-06T02:40:41Z", "jsonmodel_type": "telephone", "user_mtime": "2014-12-06T02:40:41Z", "number": "(212) 606-3834 or (212) 535-0400", "last_modified_by": "admin", "uri": "/telephone/7", "create_time": "2014-12-06T02:40:41Z"}]}], "is_linked_to_published_record": true, "linked_agent_roles": ["creator", "source", "subject"], "rights_statements": [], "create_time": "2014-12-06T02:40:41Z", "agent_type": "agent_corporate_entity", "created_by": "admin", "related_agents": [], "display_name": {"lock_version": 0, "system_mtime": "2015-06-12T20:34:39Z", "jsonmodel_type": "name_corporate_entity", "use_dates": [], "user_mtime": "2014-12-06T02:40:41Z", "sort_name_auto_generate": true, "last_modified_by": "admin", "sort_name": "Commonwealth Fund", "is_display_name": true, "source": "lcnaf", "create_time": "2014-12-06T02:40:41Z", "primary_name": "Commonwealth Fund", "created_by": "admin", "authorized": true}, "publish": true}
