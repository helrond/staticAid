In the latter part of his career Pais became known for his histories of physics, most notably \"Inward Bound: Of Matter and Forces in the Physical World,\" and his biographies of Albert Einstein, \"Subtle is the Lord,\" and Niels Bohr, \"Niels Bohr's Times.\" Professor Pais died on July 28, 2000.",
