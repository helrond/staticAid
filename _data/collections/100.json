In a hotel building donated by the French government and with a $20,000 grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, Carrel set up a special hospital to combine research with treatment in order to find better methods of combating severe bacterial infections of lacerated wounds.  Henry Drysdale Dakin, an English biochemist who had worked for a time with Christian Herter at the RIMR, joined Carrel.  Dakin developed a solution of sodium hypochlorite buffered with sodium bicarbonate that was used in the irrigation of wounds after radical surgery removed the injured tissue.\n\nWhen the United states entered World War I, the Rockefeller Foundation again grained money to carrel to set up a hospital where American and French military surgeons could be trained in the Carrel-Dakin treatment.  In six weeks, the grounds of the Institute accommodated sixteen portable hospitals.  each of the hospitals had two wards of 25 beds each and an operating pavilion.  The designs for these temporary hospitals were tested for their applicability to the conditions at the front.\n\nTwice each month, beginning August 2, 1917 and lasting until March 29, 1919, doctors were assigned to the War Demonstration Hospital by the Surgeon General to take a two-week course in the Carrel-Dakin method.  Edric Smith, the Assistant Business Manager, ran the War Demonstration Hospital for Henry James, the Business Manager, who had enlisted in the Army.  Major George A. Stewart was assigned to the War Demonstration Hospital by the Surgeon General in September 1917.  Stewart had received his medical degree from the Johns Hopkins Medical School and Hospital and had worked at the St. Agnes Hospital in Baltimore.  At the War Demonstration Hospital, he organized the clinical service and laboratory courses.  On February 14, 1918, Stewart was placed in charge in Carrel's absence and named Surgeon-in-Chief.\n\nMary L. Whitney was appointed Superintendent of the War Demonstration Hospital, with Eleanor G. Evans as Assistant Superintendent.  They supervised the daily operation of the hospital and were in charge of the training of the nurses.\n\nIn March, 1919, the RIMR began shutting down the War Demonstration Hospital, which formally closed in April.  When used, the Carrel-Dakin treatment was effective; however, the procedure was too involved for military surgeons and required too much equipment and training for civilian surgeons.  The treatment ended up being used only for trivial wounds until penicillin was discovered, when it was discarded altogether.", "publish": true, "jsonmodel_type": "note_text"}], "jsonmodel_type": "note_multipart", "publish": true}, {"persistent_id": "31824657a1d8cd2f456a2d9dbcab1973", "type": "userestrict", "subnotes": [{"content": "RAC users must abide by all applicable provisions of United States copyright law.
